# Binary Exponentiation

This repository contains an implementation of Binary Exponentiation in Java.

## Overview

Binary exponentiation (also known as exponentiation by squaring) is an efficient method for calculating large powers of a number. It works by reducing the problem size at each step, which results in a logarithmic time complexity.

## Features

- Efficient computation of large powers
- Handles both positive and negative exponents
- Simple and easy-to-understand code

## Usage

To use the binary exponentiation implementation in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/DipankarSethi3012/Binary_Exponentation.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd Binary_Exponentation

3. Compile the Java files:
    javac BinaryExponentiation.java
    
4. Run the program:
java BinaryExponentiation


## Example

Here's an example of how to use the binary exponentiation method:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BinaryExponentiation be = new BinaryExponentiation();
        int base = 2;
        int exponent = 10;
        int result = be.pow(base, exponent);
        System.out.println(base + "^" + exponent + " = " + result);
    }
}
```
